# Shadfin -> App

## Disclaimer
This contains the source code for the web app. 
It may eventually be renamed to web, as I plan on making native alternatives at least for mobile devices.

## Demo
https://main.shadfin-standalone.pages.dev

## Self-Hosting
- Docker Image: See the [compose](https://github.com/Shadfin/app/blob/master/.docker/docker-compose.yml) file
- Artifact ZIP: Check the workflow tab and download one of the artifacts, this will let you host a completely static SPA.

## Warning
This is not a replacement for Jellyfin's existing web client and many features are missing or don't work.
