# Shadfin -> App

This contains the source code for the web app. 
It may eventually be renamed to web, as I plan on making native alternatives at least for mobile devices.

You can try a demo here: https://main.shadfin-standalone.pages.dev/setup this requires you to use your own jellyfin server, or use the demo one.
There is a docker image for easy deployments, otherwise check the artifacts in the actions tab to download the 'static' SPA site.

This is not a replacement for Jellyfin's existing web client and many features are missing or don't work.
